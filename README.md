**In this work, we propose a machine-learning based approach to eatimate branch support in phylogenies**

1. Our work is based on simulations of many MSAs, and applying tree-searches using several phylogenetic softwares. The simulations generation is implemented in the 'simulations_generation_folder'.
Simulations are performed based on empirical trees.
3. After running the simulaions and tree-searches, we extract features from the inferred ML trees, in the 'simulation_edit' folder.
4. Finally, we use the extracted features to predict branch support values, as implemented in the 'ML_pipeline' folder.
